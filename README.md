## 1. Problem Statement
Manually determining whether a customer will agree to a term deposit is a complex and time-consuming process, especially when dealing with a large and diverse customer base. This challenge arises from the wide variety of customer profiles and the difficulty in identifying patterns in such data without advanced tools. However, with the development of predictive modeling, the task of assessing the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit can be streamlined. By leveraging historical customer data, a predictive model can automatically evaluate the probability of subscription based on key features, significantly reducing manual effort and enhancing decision-making.
## 2. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that will predict whether a customer will agree to a term deposit subscription based on demographic features, financial status, etc. This predictive model will automate the process of customer segmentation and improve the bank's ability to target customers more efficiently, ultimately increasing the rate of term deposit subscriptions.
## 3. Data Description
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a banking institution.  
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
